# iTrust Platform â€“ Decentralized Identity & Credential Management

The **iTrust Project** is a modular, extensible platform for managing decentralized identities and verifiable credentials (VCs) using modern authentication and verification standards.

It consists of the following core components:

| Repo Name               | Purpose                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `itrust-web`           | Admin console for managing tenants, onboarding, and configurations |
| `itrust-user-console`  | End-user console to manage life events, digital address, and VCs   |
| `itrust-auth-widget`   | Embeddable widget to handle secure user authentication            |
| `itrust-schema`        | Repository of W3C-compliant verifiable credential schemas         |

All services are configurable via `.env` files and integrate with the **DAS (Digital Address Service)** backend.
